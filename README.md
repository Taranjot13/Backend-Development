This repository is a comprehensive and curated collection of backend development classes, notes, and projects. It is designed to be a learning resource, covering a wide range of server-side programming concepts from foundational to advanced topics.

## 🚀 Features

*   **In-depth Lectures:** Each lecture (`lec-*`) folder covers a specific topic in backend development.
*   **Practical Code Examples:** Hands-on code examples to illustrate concepts.
*   **Project-Based Learning:** Includes mini-projects to apply what you've learned.
*   **Focus on Modern Technologies:** Covers popular frameworks and tools like Node.js, Express, Prisma, and more.
*   **Testing:** Includes examples of unit and integration testing with Jest and Supertest.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into lecture-based directories. Each `lec-*` directory corresponds to a class or topic.

```
.
├── lec 1/
├── lec 2/
├── ...
├── lec 42/
└── README.md
```

Each lecture directory contains code files (`.js`, `.ts`), notes (`.md`), and sometimes `package.json` for specific dependencies.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Taranjot13/Backend-Development.git
```

Navigate into a specific lecture directory to explore the code and examples. For lectures with a `package.json` file, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
cd class/lec-{lecture_number}
npm install
```
